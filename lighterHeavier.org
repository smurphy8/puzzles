* Problem Statement

There are 12 coins which you bought for 8 coins.  
You found out there was a fake so you can't use any until you figure out which one is a fake.
You can use the city scale to weigh the coin to see if it is lighter or heavier than the real ones. (you know it will be)
But this scale costs 1 coin per use (which you will only have to pay when done).
To break even, you need to figure out which coin is fake in no more than 3 moves.

* Problem Formalism 
1. Create state tables to list (unique) coin assignments
2. Create Measurement Assignment Table  to balance 

** measurement States
*** R Right side heavier
*** L Left  side heavier
*** 0 Both  sides are the same

* Correct Solution !!!

** Balanced assignment
+ I forgot that balance is also a constraint in my first attempt!
++ This means that each measurement must have the property of balancing if the coins were even 
   the max on one side is then 6
